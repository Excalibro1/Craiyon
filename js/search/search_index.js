\n\n\nSimple discord bot which generates collages based on any query you give it (most of the time). This bot uses model which you can find here\n(back to top)\n\nBuilt With\n\nTypescript\nDiscord.js\nCollage\nCanvas\namqp-client.js\nSentry.io\nJest\nCodecov\nDocker\nNestJs\nCompodoc\nMongo\nTypeORM\nGraphQl\n\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nPrerequisites\nThis is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.\n\nnpmnpm install npm@latest -g\n\nInstallation\n\nCreate Discord application on a free API Key at https://discord.com/developers/\n\nClick on Bot tab and save your token.\n\nClone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/karafra/ai-art.git\nInstall NPM packages\nnpm install\nEnter your API key and bot id into config.yml. \nsentry:\n  dsn: \"{SENTRY_DSN}\"\n# This one is optional ... only if you want to use ai-story command\nopenAi:\n  token: ...\namqp:\n  url: \"{AMQP_URL}\"\ndiscord:\n    token: \"{DISCORD_TOKEN}\"\ndeploy:\n  port: \"{PORT}\" Configuration file supports simple environment variable substitution in format \"{VARIABLE_NAME}\", where parentheses are required.\n\n\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nDeployment\nMethod 1: Deployment to Heroku\nRecommended method of deploying this bot is deployment on Heroku. To deploy to Heroku please click on button bellow.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nAfter successful deployment you will have to switch dyno from web to worker. If you do not do this, app will not bind to port and fail. \n\n  \n\n\nAfter successful deployment you can invite bot to your server by clicking on this link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&permissions=34816&scope=applications.commands%20bot, where CLIENT_ID is your bots client id. Link already contains minimal scopes (bot, application.commands) and minimal bot permissions (send messages, attach files)\nMethod 2: Containerized deployment:\nAnother even easier method of deployment is deployment via docker container.\n\nVerify docker-compose installation\n A] Type docker-compose -v into terminal. if output looks similar to docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c then you can continue to the next step.\n B] If this command throws an error, you have to follow docker-compose installation guide\n\nSet required variables\n\nOnly required variables is TOKEN, this can be set as environment variables using export ENV_NAME=VALUE on linux based OS or $env:VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE on Windows based OS\n\n\nBuilding Docker containers\n\n\n\nType docker-compose -f \"docker/deploy/docker-compose.yml\" build into terminal, this will automatically build all required docker images.\n\n\nStart container\nType docker-compose -f \"docker/deploy/docker-compose.yml\" up into terminal. This will start all services needed. RabbitMQ management console will be accessible here with login credentials being:\n\nusername:   \nguest\n\n\npassword:\nguest\n\n\n\n\nMongoDb management console will be accessible here without any login credentials\n\n\n\n\nThis network is not external, so it will not be accessible from outside.\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nUsage\nCommands are separated into 2 command groups\n\nhelp - Help command \n\n/ai-art\n\ncog-view-2 - Generates collage of 9 images using CogView2 model\ndalle-mini - Generates collage of 9 images using Dall-e mini model\nwombo-dream - Generartes one image based on WomboDream model\n\n\n/ai-story\n\nstory - Generates story from given headline (Requires OpenAi API) token\n\n\nReact with :envelope: to any collage and bot will dm it to you.\n\n\nDiscord offers autocompletion so all you need is to start typing name of the command or group in which command is, discord will then guide you through all the required parameters using its autocompletion.\n\n  \n\n\nFor more examples, please refer to the Documentation\n(back to top)\n\n\n\nContributing\nContributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.\nIf you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag \"enhancement\".\nDon't forget to give the project a star!
